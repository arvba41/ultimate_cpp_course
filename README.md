# Ultimate C++ Course
This repository contains the code for the Ultimate C++ Course. The course is divided into 3 main sections:

## PMSM simulation and control 
How fast is C++ compared to Python and Matlab? In this section, 100 simulations of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with field oriented control are performed, and the table below summarizes the results.

| time | C++ | Python _(jit)_ | Matlab | Python |
|----------| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| $\mu$ | 235.14 ms | 641.42 ms| 11.78 s | 31. 42 or 61s | 
| $\sigma$ | 9.64 ms | 104.34 ms | 0.04 s | 2.57 or 5.7s|
