# Questions to Erik

## Debugging vs Build and run 
build and run, visa terminal, (of course using came:build): directories are not the same when "pressing F5" (debugg using LLDB), what on earth is happening.
* Bodged by using a macro but this does not seem like a good solution because the macro can be acidentally (mistakenly) disabled (uncommented, etc.) during release, how to deal with this? (Apart from the obvious ofcourse) (*Example from lab1/wordlength*)
* Compilor flags in the time.pdf documentation, page 6.
* How to create an equivalent using CMake?.
* How important is "Test-driven development", for our course? Is it sufficient ot learn the syntax and features or should the course also teach the "eticates / procedures" for developing software?
